  intro: [
    `Traditional intelligence gathering utilizes manual search engine based methods to gather vast amounts of information that is crucial in facilitating decision making in all areas of biopharma: discovery, R&D, clinical trial design, and more.`,
    `Often, the manual effort required to collate, structure and synthesize such vast information in a consumable format suited for deriving key insights that impact decisions is time consuming. On the other hand, curated market research reports are limited in scope and contain little to no real-time information.`,

  solution: {
    intro: [
      `As the process of gathering intel for such use cases has repetitive elements, there is scope for unlocking efficiencies in putting together this intel by leveraging the latest technologies in web mining, data pipelining and artificial intelligence.`,

    solutionPoints: [
      `Aganitha’s solution utilizes an army of bots to feed off data sources`,
      `The information is then processed and ingested by a knowledge graph with relevant nodes and edges that capture key entities and their relationships`,
      `Automation ensures long term robustness and replicability without sacrificing flexibility`,
