    The biopharma industry is in the <span class="">early stages of a dramatic
      transformation </span> in how it operates, from the discovery of drugs to clinical trials to clinical operations.
    This creates an opportunity to develop a framework for rapidly identifying and bringing to market new treatments for
    diseases. The transformation is happening in three key areas: research and development, clinical trials, and
    clinical operations.

  <h2 class="mx-auto mb-6 ag-h4 title-font">
    We refer to this as the <span class="font-bold text-ag-secondary-red"> computational transformation of biopharma
      processes </span>. This digital transformation of the core business is important for the next generation of
    biopharma companies to succeed. The core drivers and capabilities that are key to this transformation include the
    ability to process large amounts of information (example: genomic data), automation of the information flows, and
    <span class="italic">in silico</span> modeling bringing together AI/ML, chemistry and biology domains.

  <h2 class="mx-auto mb-4 ag-h4 title-font">
    A few examples include:

  <ul class="list-inside list-disc ag-h4">
    <li class="mb-2">
      Successfully managing <span class="italic">in silico, in vitro, ex vivo,</span> and
